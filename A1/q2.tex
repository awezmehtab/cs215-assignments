\begin{que}
	You are playing a trading game against two teams $A$ and $B$ (will happen
	in reality soon). The game is played in the form of a three-set series
	with $A$ and $B$ alternately. Also, Team $B$ is better at trading than Team
	$A$. To encourage your trading career, the exchange (an organization
	responsible for managing the trades) gives you two options $A$-$B$-$A$ (which
	means you play a game with Team $A$, then Team $B$ and at last Team $A$
	again) or $B$-$A$-$B$. You will win if you win two sets in a row. Which of
	the two options should you choose? Justify your choice with proper
	calculations.

		Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ be the probability of winning the set against $A$ and $B$ respectively. Since, Team $B$ is better than team $A$,
        \[p_A>p_B\]
        For the first option, i.e. A-B-A, to win, we either have to win first and second set and lose the third set or win the second and third set and lose the first set or we can win all of them. Probability of this happening is, (let it be $P_1$)
        \[=p_A\times p_B \times (1-p_A)+(1-p_A)\times p_B\times p_A +p_A\times p_B\times p_A\]
        \[=p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B+p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B+p_A^2p_B\]
        \[=2p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B\]
        Similary for second option, which is B-A-B, the probablity for winning will be(let it be $P_2$)
        \[=p_B\times p_A \times (1-p_B)+(1-p_B)\times p_A\times p_B +p_B\times p_A\times p_B\]
        \[=p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2+p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2+p_Ap_B^2\]
        \[=2p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2\]
        We know that,
        \[p_A>p_B\]
        As, both $p_A$ and $p_B$ is positive, we can multiple them to both the sides without changing the inequality sign,
        \[p_A\times p_Ap_B > p_B\times p_Ap_B\]
        \[p_A^2p_B > p_Ap_B^2\]
        Multiplying $-1$ on both the sides,
        \[-p_A^2p_B < -p_Ap_B^2\]
        Adding $2p_Ap_B$ on both the sides,
        \[ 2p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B < 2p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2\]
        Which is basically,
        \[P_1 < P_2\]
        So, playing in the \textbf{second} order will give us better chances to win the game.
