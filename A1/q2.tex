\begin{que}
	You are playing a trading game against two teams $A$ and $B$ (will happen
	in reality soon). The game is played in the form of a three-set series
	with $A$ and $B$ alternately. Also, Team $B$ is better at trading than Team
	$A$. To encourage your trading career, the exchange (an organization
	responsible for managing the trades) gives you two options $A$-$B$-$A$ (which
	means you play a game with Team $A$, then Team $B$ and at last Team $A$
	again) or $B$-$A$-$B$. You will win if you win two sets in a row. Which of
	the two options should you choose? Justify your choice with proper
	calculations.

		Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ be the probability of winning the set against Team $A$ and Team $B$ respectively. Since, Team $B$ is better than team $A$, we know that,
        \[p_A>p_B\]
        For the first sequence, (i.e. A-B-A), to result in a win, we either have to win first and second set and lose the third set, or win the second and third set and lose the first set win all three sets. Probability of this happening is, (denoted as $P_1$)
        \[P_1=p_A\times p_B \times (1-p_A)+(1-p_A)\times p_B\times p_A +p_A\times p_B\times p_A\]
        \[P_1=p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B+p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B+p_A^2p_B\]
        \[P_1=2p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B\]
        Similary for second sequence, (i.e, B-A-B), the probablity for winning will be(let it be $P_2$)
        \[P_2=p_B\times p_A \times (1-p_B)+(1-p_B)\times p_A\times p_B +p_B\times p_A\times p_B\]
        \[P_2=p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2+p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2+p_Ap_B^2\]
        \[P_2=2p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2\]
        Since we know that,
        \[p_A>p_B\]
        As, both $p_A$ and $p_B$ is positive, we can multiple them to both the sides without changing the inequality sign,
        \[p_A\times p_Ap_B > p_B\times p_Ap_B\]
        This gives us:
        \[p_A^2p_B > p_Ap_B^2\]
        Multiplying $-1$ on both the sides,
        \[-p_A^2p_B < -p_Ap_B^2\]
        Adding $2p_Ap_B$ on both the sides,
        \[ 2p_Ap_B-p_A^2p_B < 2p_Ap_B-p_Ap_B^2\]
        Which simplifies to,
        \[P_1 < P_2\]
        So, playing in the \textbf{second} sequence(B-A-B) gives us better chances of winning the game.
