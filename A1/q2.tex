\begin{que}
	You are playing a trading game against two teams $A$ and $B$ (will happen
	in reality soon). The game is played in the form of a three-set series
	with $A$ and $B$ alternately. Also, Team $B$ is better at trading than Team
	$A$. To encourage your trading career, the exchange (an organization
	responsible for managing the trades) gives you two options $A$-$B$-$A$ (which
	means you play a game with Team $A$, then Team $B$ and at last Team $A$
	again) or $B$-$A$-$B$. You will win if you win two sets in a row. Which of
	the two options should you choose? Justify your choice with proper
	calculations.
