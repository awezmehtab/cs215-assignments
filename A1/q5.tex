\begin{que}
	Imagine an infinitely long line of traders waiting outside a brokerage firm to
	place their trades. Each trader is assigned an ID number from 1 to 200 (both
	inclusive, obviously these IDs are not unique). The firm’s director announces
	a special offer: the first trader in the queue whose ID number matches the ID
	of any trader who has already placed a trade will receive a free trade (i.e.,
	a trade without any margins). You have the option to choose your position in
	this queue.   However, you don’t know the ID numbers of the traders ahead of
	you or behind you. Your goal is to maximize your chances of being the first
	trader whose ID matches someone who has already placed a trade. Given this
	situation, what position in the queue should you choose to maximize your
	chances of receiving the free trade?
