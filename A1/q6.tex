\begin{que}
	Suppose that you have computed the mean, median and standard deviation of a
	set of $n$ numbers stored in array $A$ where $n$ is very large. Now, you decide
	to add another number to $A$. Write a python function to update the
	previously computed mean, another python function to update the previously
	computed median, and yet another python function to update the previously
	computed standard deviation. Note that you are not allowed to simply
	recompute the mean, median or standard deviation by looping through all the
	data. You may need to derive formulae for this. Include the formulae and
	their derivation in your report. Note that your python functions should be
	of the following form:

	\begin{verbatim}
	function newMean = UpdateMean(OldMean, NewDataValue, n, A),
	function newMedian = UpdateMedian(OldMedian, NewDataValue, n, A),
	function newStd = UpdateStd(OldMean, OldStd, NewMean, NewDataValue, n, A).
	\end{verbatim}

	Also explain, how would you update the histogram of $A$, if you received
	a new value to be added to $A$? (Only explain, no need to write code.)
	Please specify clearly if you are making any assumptions.

	\begin{sol}
		For computing new mean from previously computed mean and the new value, we just need to multiply the older mean with the size of the set and add the new value and divide the whole sum by n+1. For computing the new median, we need to append the new value to the array and then sort it. If the older n was even, we need to return the key at $\big(\frac{n+2}{2}\big)$. If older n was odd, we need to return the average of key at $\big(\frac{n+1}{2},\frac{n+2}{2}\big)$. This approach is used if the array is not sorted. If we make an assumption that the array is sorted, then we need to compare the new element with just the current median, one element just larger than the median and one element just smaller than the median and we can apply the same approach as before to compute the median. 
  \par For computing the new standard deviation, we can get the value of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(A[i])^2$ by using the old standard deviation and the mean. After that we can just add the square of the new data value to it and use the new mean value to compute the new standard deviation.
  \par If we want to update the histogram of A,we can directly find the bin range in which the value lies in and increment the value of that particular bin by 1.
  The assumptions we are making include that we already have a histogram that tracks the count of each bin and the bin ranges/width are fixed.
