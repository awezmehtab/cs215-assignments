	\textbf{To prove: }\\
	\emph{Let $X$ be a continuous real-valued random variable with CDF  : $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1]$. Assume that
	$F_X$ is invertible. Then the random variable $Y := F_X (X) \in [0, 1]$ is uniformly distributed in $[0, 1]$}\\
	\textbf{Proof:}\\
	$F_X$ by definition can also be written as
	\[F_X(x) = P(X\leq x)\]
	Define a new random variable $Y$,
	\[Y =F_X(X) \]
	Y is the result of applying CDF $F_X$ to the random variable $X$.
	To prove the theorem, assume $y\in [0,1]$. So, the probablity that $Y \leq y$ is:
	\[P(Y\leq y) = P(F_X(X)\leq y)\]
	It is assumed that $F_X(x)$ is invertible, so,
	\[P(Y\leq y) = P(X\leq F_X^{-1}(y))\]
	which is basically, probablity that $X$ is less that or equal to $F_X^{-1}(y)$. This can be written in the CDF form, which is $F_X(F_X^{-1}(y))$. So,
	\[P(Y\leq y) = P(X\leq F_X^{-1}(y)) = F_X(F_X^{-1}(y)) = y\]
	So,
	\[P(Y\leq y) = y\]
	where $y\in [0,1]$, which is the CDF of uniform distributon in $[0,1]$.
	So, Y is a uniform distributon in $[0,1]$ regardless of $X$.
