		\textbf{To prove: }\\
		\emph{Let $X$ be a continuous real-valued random variable with CDF  : $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1]$. Assume that
		$F_X$ is invertible. Then the random variable $Y := F_X (X) \in [0, 1]$ is uniformly distributed in $[0, 1]$}\\
		\textbf{Proof:}\\
		$F_X$ by definition can also be written as
		\[F_X(x) = P(X\leq x)\]
		Define a new random variable $Y$,
		\[Y =F_X(X) \]
		Y is the result of applying CDF $F_X$ to the random variable $X$.
		To prove the theorem, assume $y\in [0,1]$. So, the probablity that $Y \leq y$ is:
		\[P(Y\leq y) = P(F_X(X)\leq y)\]
		It is assumed that $F_X(x)$ is invertible, so,
		\[P(Y\leq y) = P(X\leq F_X^{-1}(y))\]
		which is basically, probablity that $X$ is less that or equal to $F_X^{-1}(y)$. This can be written in the CDF form, which is $F_X(F_X^{-1}(y))$. So,
		\[P(Y\leq y) = P(X\leq F_X^{-1}(y)) = F_X(F_X^{-1}(y)) = y\]
		So,
		\[P(Y\leq y) = y\]
		where $y\in [0,1]$, which is the CDF of uniform distributon in $[0,1]$.
	So, Y is a uniform distributon in $[0,1]$ regardless of $X$.
	\tcbsubtitle{Task B}
		According to the theorem proved above, CDF of any random variable $X$ mapped with itself gives a uniform
		random variable $Y$ in $[0,1]$. So, let $Y\sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$. Then for any random variable $X$,
		\begin{align}
			F_X(X) & = Y \\
			X & = F_X^{-1}(Y)
		\end{align}
		\textbf{Algorithm $\mathcal{A}$:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Input: A sample $y$ from the uniform distributon on $[0,1]$.
			\item Transformation:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Apply the inverse CDF to $y$ to compute a sample $u$.
				\item Define $\mathcal{A}(u) = u = F_X^{-1}(y)$
			\end{itemize}
			\item Output: The random variable $U = F_X^{-1}(Y)$
		\end{enumerate}
		This gives us the correct required random variables as, CDF of U is $F_U(u)$,
		\begin{align}
			P(U\leq u ) & = P(F_X(Y) \leq u)\\
			F_U(u) & =  P(F_X(F_X^{-1}(X) \leq u))\\
			F_U(u) & =  P(X \leq u) \\
			F_U(u) & =  F_X(u) \\ 
		\end{align}
		$U$ and $X$ have the same CDF, which was initially required.
\end{solution}
